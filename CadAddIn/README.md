# SWSNG
**S**olid**W**orks **S**erial **N**o. **G**enerator

An example of a CAD add-in that uses the SWSNG serial number generator when **Saving As** from CAD.

# How the add-in works
Before the **Save As** dialogue is displayed, a window is opened to select one of the available number ranges. Then the **default filename** in the dialogue will be replaced with the **filename from the database**. If no number range is selected, the routine will be terminated.
